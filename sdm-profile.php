                   <p> What is the thing that clicks in Bushahr? What brings them the sense of togetherness? It's this exploration that led to facilitating a podium called 'Benevolent Bushahr.’ Benevolent Bushahr is a broad platform of few social experiments to convert the huge youth prominence of the region to a unique demographic benefit that makes India the most successful country of the 21st century. 'Benevolent Bushahr’ attempts to realize the dream, a better tomorrow for Rampur Bushahr, Himachal Pradesh, India and the Indians!</p> 
<p>A Bushahr where people willfully abide by the laws of the land, where people exercise better civic sense, where everyone explores their inner capabilities to the fullest, where everyone devotionally practice cleanliness, where children are mentored appropriately so that they don't suffer from behavioral, emotional, social and learning issues and an India where parents, teachers and society are scientifically enabled to fulfill their responsibilities towards children.</p>
<p>Being there for the other person, we believe is an inherent quality or feeling within ourselves. It's standing together for the others that bring out the best in us. The collective consciousness of a place is as important as our own individual consciousness.</p>
<p>Bushahr over the years has captured the imagination of the public when it comes to its warmth, hospitality and compassion. Benevolent Bushahr is a platform to celebrate the lives of many kind hearted people and to bring together like minded people who can create a holistic destination out of Bushahr. Benevolent Bushahr is an attempt to 'Create Better Places for People to Live and Visit’. Benevolent Bushahr is all about that attitude. It's about the culture of sharing; sharing for the betterment of people and places.</p> 
<p>A plethora of initiatives have been launched and some more will be launched in the coming three months by the Sub Divisional Administration in partnership with civil society, Government agencies and citizens, who volunteer to create an authentic and inspirational destination for them to live and invite people to visit and be part of their lives and experiences. We can only be facilitators and to some extent be the match makers. However Benevolent Bushahr can become a success story only if all of us come together selflessly.</p>
